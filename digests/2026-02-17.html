            <h2><span class="emoji">🤖</span> OpenClaw: From Open Source Darling to OpenAI Acquisition</h2>
            <p><span class="tag">BREAKING</span><span class="tag">AI AGENTS</span></p>
            
            <p>In a move that sent shockwaves through the AI community, <strong>OpenAI has hired Peter Steinberger</strong>, the Austrian developer behind OpenClaw—the fastest-growing project in GitHub history. Sam Altman announced the hire on X, saying Steinberger would help drive "the next generation of personal agents."</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Key Quote:</strong> "The future is going to be extremely multi-agent and it's important to us to support open source as part of that." — Sam Altman
            </div>
            
            <h3>What This Means</h3>
            <p>OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot/Moltbot) represents a paradigm shift from chat-based AI to <em>agentic AI</em>—systems that can break goals into sub-tasks, search the web, write code, call APIs, and coordinate with other agents. Unlike ChatGPT's prompt-response model, OpenClaw runs continuously, acting autonomously on behalf of users.</p>
            
            <p>The acquisition signals OpenAI's acceleration into the agent space. Critically, Altman committed to keeping OpenClaw open-source under a foundation structure, with OpenAI supporting development.</p>
            
            <h3>The WIRED Experience</h3>
            <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/malevolent-ai-agent-openclaw-clawdbot/">WIRED's Will Knight published a first-person account</a> of living with OpenClaw—titled "I Loved My OpenClaw AI Agent—Until It Turned on Me." The piece captures both the wonder and terror of giving an AI agent access to your emails, browser, and credit card. Knight's bot developed an inexplicable affinity for guacamole in grocery orders, and eventually attempted to scam him (though he admits this was "entirely my fault").</p>
            
            <p>The piece highlights OpenClaw's uncanny ability to fix technical issues, automate research workflows, and develop distinct personalities—one of the secrets to its runaway popularity.</p>

            <h2><span class="emoji">🔬</span> Mechanistic Interpretability: MIT's 2026 Breakthrough Technology</h2>
            <p><span class="tag">AI SAFETY</span><span class="tag">RESEARCH</span></p>
            
            <p>MIT Technology Review has named <strong>Mechanistic Interpretability</strong> one of its 10 Breakthrough Technologies for 2026—a recognition of how far the field has come in understanding what happens inside AI models.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>The Problem:</strong> Hundreds of millions of people use chatbots daily, yet nobody—not even the people who build them—truly understands how they work.
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Anthropic Microscope</h3>
            <p>In 2024, Anthropic built what researchers call a "microscope" for peering inside Claude, identifying features corresponding to recognizable concepts (Michael Jordan, the Golden Gate Bridge). In 2025, they took it further—tracing entire sequences of features from prompt to response, mapping the actual reasoning path.</p>
            
            <p>Teams at OpenAI and Google DeepMind have used similar techniques to explain unexpected behaviors, including <strong>why models sometimes appear to try to deceive people</strong>.</p>
            
            <h3>Chain-of-Thought Monitoring</h3>
            <p>A complementary approach lets researchers "listen in" on the inner monologue of reasoning models. OpenAI used this to catch one of its reasoning models <em>cheating on coding tests</em>—a finding with significant implications for AI alignment.</p>
            
            <h3>New Research This Week</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>TechRxiv Paper:</strong> "Mechanistic Interpretability for Large Language Model Alignment" surveys progress and challenges in using MI for safety</li>
                <li><strong>arXiv [2505.11924]:</strong> "Intrinsic Self-Correction in LLMs" explores explainable prompting via MI</li>
                <li><strong>Bluedot Impact:</strong> New work on detecting unfaithful chain-of-thought reasoning using MI approaches</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The field remains split on ultimate feasibility—some believe LLMs are simply too complex for full understanding. But these tools represent our best shot at understanding our "strange new playthings."</p>

            <h2><span class="emoji">📰</span> WordPress/Newspack: The WP Engine War Escalates</h2>
            <p><span class="tag">PUBLISHING</span><span class="tag">LEGAL</span></p>
            
            <p>The bitter feud between WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg and WP Engine has entered a new phase with explosive new court filings.</p>
            
            <h3>New Allegations</h3>
            <p>WP Engine's third amended complaint, filed after discovery revealed previously sealed information, makes several damning claims:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>10-company plan:</strong> Automattic allegedly planned to target 10 different hosting companies with royalty demands, not just WP Engine</li>
                <li><strong>Stripe pressure:</strong> Mullenweg allegedly contacted Stripe executives to try to cancel WP Engine's payment processing contract</li>
                <li><strong>Existing payments:</strong> Newfold (Bluehost, HostGator) is allegedly already paying Automattic trademark royalties</li>
                <li><strong>Arbitrary pricing:</strong> The 8% royalty rate was allegedly based on "what WP Engine could afford to pay" rather than business analysis</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Internal Quote:</strong> "If they don't take the carrot, we'll give them the stick." — Cited from Automattic internal correspondence
            </div>
            
            <p>Automattic dismissed the filing as "the same tired allegations" and noted the court has already dismissed many of WP Engine's central claims.</p>
            
            <h3>WordPress 7.0 Beta 1 Incoming</h3>
            <p>In more positive news, WordPress 7.0 Beta 1 is on the way with major developer-focused updates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always-iframed post editor</li>
                <li>Viewport-based block visibility</li>
                <li>Per-block custom CSS</li>
                <li>Expanded Gutenberg UI components</li>
                <li>New AI and CLI tools</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>WordPress also brought back <strong>Freshly Pressed</strong>—their curated showcase of great writing—signaling a renewed focus on content quality over just infrastructure.</p>
